## Installation
- Clone this repository and move to the root folder of the repository.
- Create a venv with python3.12:
     ```
     python3.12 -m venv venv
     ```
- Activate the venv:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
- Install the required packages:
     ```
     python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## ECG Data

A few samples from the PTB-XL  dataset are already stored in [data](./data/ptb-xl/00000). If you with to generate a diverse dataset, you should download the full dataset. If you use the examples or the full dataset, please cite:

1. Wagner, P., Strodthoff, N., Bousseljot, R., Samek, W., & Schaeffter, T. (2022). PTB-XL, a large publicly available electrocardiography dataset (version 1.0.3). PhysioNet. doi: [10.13026/kfzx-aw45](https://doi.org/10.13026/kfzx-aw45)

## Run the pipeline
1. Take a look in the [config file](./src/config/config.yml)
2. Run the pipeline with the following command:
     ```
     python src/generate_images.py
     ```
